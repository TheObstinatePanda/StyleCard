# StyleCard Tool 

*This is a personal project to create a tool useful to quickly test different 'swatches' for website creation. It is not intended for sale or use within any paid service*

**NOTE** *This is the alpha realease of this app, It is not the final product, features will continue to be updated*

## Features: 

A 'swatch' display that contains 3 different headings (<H1> through <H3>), <p> tags, a <button>, and a short list using <ul> tags.

Below the swatch there are inputs for each style applied to these tags for you to change to a value of you choice.  These can take any standard CSS input that would work with the Property listed. 

## How to Use:  

Use the input fields to change the value of the precedeing property.  For example, if you want to change the Font Family of the <p> tag, go to the block beneath **Paragraph** and find the input box to the right of "Font Family", type in a font that is included with default CSS and the displayed <p> tag text in the swatch will change.

This same process applies to all of the properties that have been included in this release
